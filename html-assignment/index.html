            <p>My name is Nathan Templeton and I am a student at Algonquin College. I am a person who enjoys learning <em>new things</em>, with myself having learnt many hobbies in my freetime. I have become proficient with many instruments including the piano, guitar, saxophone and harmonica. I enjoy playing piano the most in my free time and like to improvise and try to learn new songs written or by ear. I am also a great artist, as drawing was a skill that I had picked up during the pandemic. I enjoy sketching characters and landscapes in fantasy, but also relish in drawing still lifes and things of that nature. Alongside these pastimes I also enjoy many other of the finer things in life like reading, exercising, video games, 3D modeling, and of course eating good food.</p>
            <p>Many of these new skills were not yet learnt by me before the Covid-19 pandemic. I can still remember the day of March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020, when my high school shut down. Naturally being a young teenager with no responsibilities and school for months, I resorted to playing video games <em>all day</em>. While fun at first, playing Animal Crossing and <abbr title="Final Fantasy">FF</abbr> for far too long can start messing with your head and I decided to make a change and begin improving myself. I decided to adopt this mindset, <blockquote> <q>It is never too late to be who you might have been</q> <cite>-George Elliot.</cite> </blockquote> I started to lose weight, and learn to draw from the ground up. Since starting my <em>self-improvement journey</em> I have felt much more fulfilled and proud in my life.</p>
